# Dotfiles & Shell Styles

This repository contains my personal **shell design**, **prompt configuration**, and other **UI / terminal styles** that I use across my systems.

I keep these files here so I can easily sync my setup between devices.

## Usage

Feel free to:
- Use anything you like
- Copy or adapt the configs
- Learn from them for your own setup

No guarantees, no strict structure — just styles I enjoy using.
